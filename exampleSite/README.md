This is an example site for the [`plain-blog` Hugo theme](https://github.com/LiaungYip/plain-blog).

You can use it to see what the `config.toml` should look like, or use it as the start of your very own `plain-blog` site!

You can get a copy by doing:

    git clone https://github.com/LiaungYip/plain-blog-example.git --recursive

Where the `--recursive` option makes git download the `plain-blog` theme for you automatically. Neat!
